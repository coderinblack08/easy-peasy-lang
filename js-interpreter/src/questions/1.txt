1. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Solution:
func gcd(a, b)
  if b == 0
    return a
  end
  return gcd(b, a % b)
end

func lcm(a, b)
  return a * b / gcd(a, b)
end

i = 1
ans = 1
while i <= 20
  total = lcm(ans, i)
  i = i + 1
end

Out(ans)
